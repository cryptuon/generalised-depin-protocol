#  Generalised DePIN Protocol: A Framework for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks 
This paper introduces the Generalised DePIN (GDP) protocol, a comprehensive framework for decentralized physical infrastructure networks. GDP establishes a modular system, enabling tailored application across sectors like ridesharing and power systems. Leveraging device onboarding, multi-sensor redundancy, and a reward/penalty mechanism, GDP promotes genuine behavior and ensures network-wide vigilance. Through continuous audits and updates, the protocol remains dynamic, ensuring sustainable decentralized operations.
